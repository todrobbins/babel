### [Low Power FM (LPFM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-power_broadcasting)

> Low-power broadcasting is broadcasting by a broadcast station at a low electric power to a smaller service area than "full power" stations within the same region. It is often distinguished from "micropower broadcasting" (more commonly "microbroadcasting") and broadcast translators. LPAM, LPFM and LPTV are in various levels of use across the world, varying widely based on the laws and their enforcement.

- [KickSat - Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KickSat)

#### [Femtosatellites](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_satellite#Femtosatellites)

> The term "femtosatellite" or "femtosat" is usually applied to artificial satellites with a wet mass below 100 g (3.5 oz). Like picosatellites, some designs require a larger "mother" satellite for communication with ground controllers.

### [Eco-fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecofascism)

> Ecofascism is a theoretical political model in which a totalitarian government would require individuals to sacrifice their own interests to the "organic whole of nature" and which would rely on militarism and expansionism. The term is also used as a rhetorical pejorative to undermine the environmental movement and in the United Kingdom, it has been used to describe far-right efforts to gain influence within the Green Party of England and Wales.

- [“Eco-fascism is undergoing a revival in the fetid culture of the extreme right,”](https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2019/mar/20/eco-fascism-is-undergoing-a-revival-in-the-fetid-culture-of-the-extreme-right) _The Guardian_.

### [mDNS (Mulicast DNS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS)

> In computer networking, the multicast DNS (mDNS) protocol resolves host names to IP addresses within small networks that do not include a local name server. It is a zero-configuration service, using essentially the same programming interfaces, packet formats and operating semantics as the unicast Domain Name System (DNS). Although Stuart Cheshire designed mDNS as a stand-alone protocol, it can work in concert with standard DNS servers.

### Networking

- [Tier 1 network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tier_1_network)

 > A Tier 1 network is an Internet Protocol (IP) network that can reach every other network on the Internet solely via settlement-free interconnection (also known as settlement-free peering). Tier 1 networks can exchange traffic with other Tier 1 networks without having to pay any fees for the exchange of traffic in either direction, while some Tier 2 networks and all Tier 3 networks must pay to transmit traffic on other networks.

- [Peering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peering)

 > In computer networking, peering is a voluntary interconnection of administratively separate Internet networks for the purpose of exchanging traffic between the users of each network. The pure definition of peering is settlement-free, also known as "bill-and-keep," or "sender keeps all," meaning that neither party pays the other in association with the exchange of traffic; instead, each derives and retains revenue from its own customers.

#### [Carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-sense_multiple_access)

> Carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) is a media access control (MAC) protocol in which a node verifies the absence of other traffic before transmitting on a shared transmission medium, such as an electrical bus or a band of the electromagnetic spectrum.

#### [Medium access control (MAC)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_access_control)

> In IEEE 802 LAN/MAN standards, the medium access control (MAC) sublayer is the layer that controls the hardware responsible for interaction with the wired, optical or wireless transmission medium. The MAC sublayer and the logical link control (LLC) sublayer together make up the data link layer. Within the data link layer, the LLC provides flow control and multiplexing for the logical link (i.e. EtherType, 802.1Q VLAN tag etc), while the MAC provides flow control and multiplexing for the transmission medium.

- [Transmission medium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_medium)

 > A transmission medium is something that can mediate the propagation of signals for the purposes of telecommunication.

- [Logical link control](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_link_control)

 > In the IEEE 802 reference model of computer networking, the logical link control (LLC) data communication protocol layer is the upper sublayer of the data link layer (layer 2) of the seven-layer OSI model. The LLC sublayer provides multiplexing mechanisms that make it possible for several network protocols (e.g. IP, IPX, Decnet and Appletalk) to coexist within a multipoint network and to be transported over the same network medium. It can also provide flow control and automatic repeat request (ARQ) error management mechanisms.

#### [Network layer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer)

> the seven-layer OSI model of computer networking, the network layer is layer 3. The network layer is responsible for packet forwarding including routing through intermediate routers.

### Anarcho-syndicalism

> The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are solidarity, direct action (action undertaken without the intervention of third parties such as politicians, bureaucrats and arbitrators) and direct democracy, or workers' self-management. ([_Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism))

#### Study topics:
- Solidarity
- Direct action
- Direct democracy
- Workers' self-management

**Solidarity**

This is the beginning of my explorations of the various theories of solidarity as expressed by religious and secular thinkers.

> Solidarity is unity (as of a group or class) that produces or is based on unities of interests, objectives, standards, and sympathies. ([_Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity))

See also:

- [“Catholic social teaching,”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_social_teaching#Solidarity_and_the_universal_destiny_of_the_goods_of_the_Earth) _Wikipedia_:

  > “Solidarity is undoubtedly a Christian virtue. It seeks to go beyond itself to total gratuity, forgiveness, and reconciliation. It leads to a new vision of the unity of humankind, a reflection of God's triune intimate life. ...” ([John Paul II, “Sollicitudo Rei Socialis”](http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_30121987_sollicitudo-rei-socialis.html))

- United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, [“Economic Justice for All”](http://www.usccb.org/upload/economic_justice_for_all.pdf):

  > In short, nations separated by geography, culture, and ideology are linked in a complex commercial, financial, technological, and environmental network. These links have two direct consequences. First, they create hope for a new form of community among all peoples, one built on dignity, solidarity, and justice. Second, this rising global awareness calls for greater attention to the stark inequities across countries in the standards of living and control of resources. (p. 3)

- United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, [“Solidarity”](http://www.usccb.org/beliefs-and-teachings/what-we-believe/catholic-social-teaching/solidarity.cfm):

  > We are one  human family whatever our national, racial, ethnic, economic, and ideological  differences. We are our brothers’ and sisters’ keepers, wherever they may be.  Loving our neighbor has global dimensions in a shrinking world. At the core of  the virtue of solidarity is the pursuit of justice and peace. Pope Paul VI  taught that “if you want peace, work for justice.” The Gospel calls us to be  peacemakers. Our love for all our sisters and brothers demands that we promote  peace in a world surrounded by violence and conflict.

- [“Distributism,”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributism) _Wikipedia_:

  > Distributism is an economic ideology that developed in Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century based upon the principles of Catholic social teaching, especially the teachings of Pope Leo XIII in his encyclical [Rerum novarum](http://w2.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum.html) and Pope Pius XI in [Quadragesimo anno](http://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19310515_quadragesimo-anno.html).

- [“Church Represented at World Religions Conference in Kazakhstan,”](https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/church-represented-at-world-religions-conference-in-kazakhstan) _Mormon Newsroom_:

  > Elder Pieper offered three guiding principles to expand solidarity with other religions: the right to choose ones worship, friendship to all denominations and a unified approach to the world’s challenges where possible.
